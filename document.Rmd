# What's the purpose of this document?

It's to show you *just how easy it is* to craft beautiful documents in Markdown!

Note that this document has **zero R code.** We're just using RStudio as a file editor right now.

## Writing equations and code

Those of you familiar with LaTeX will note some similarities. (Even if you aren't, a cool piece of trivia: it's pronounced "lay-tek" because it's based on the TeX typesetting system, and the name TeX is technically written with Greek letters tau, epsilon, chi: $\tau \epsilon \chi$.)

Actually, writing equations in Markdown is easy and basically the same as LaTeX:
$$
y=mx+b
$$

Those are examples of two concepts that are useful Markdown terms: "inline" (code, equations) *vs.* "blocks" or "chunks". Code is delimited by back quotation marks, and TeX by dollar signs.

Surrounding any inline text with single dollar signs will make it an equation, and back quotes / back ticks (these things: \` ) will create inline code. (Depending on how you write it, this will either *just look like code* or *actually get evaluated as code*; more on this later). It might take a second to find the back tick key on your keyboard! On mine it's near the top left.

If you want your code or equation to stand alone on the page, you'll need to create a block of it. This always happens on a new line. For equations, type two dollar signs above and below the equation:

$$
A=\pi r^2
$$

And code chunks are delimited by three backticks followed by curly brackets, then the code on a new line, then another three backticks on a new line. 

```{}
"Your code goes here"
```

## Some other cool formatting 

* Bulleted list
  * Just hit "tab" to make a sub-bullet
  
1. Numbered lists
1. Numbers update automatically; you can always start them with 1. 

## You made it this far!
